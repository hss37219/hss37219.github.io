<H1><font face="Broadway">Welcome!</font></H1>
<p>Currently a Sophomore at University of Georgia, I am studying Sport management and pursuing a 
certificate in Legal Studies. I have always dreamed of attending UGA, so when I got my letter in the mail, 
I was ecstatic. Activities on campus that I have become involved in include, Alpha Phi International Fraternity,
 Cru at UGA, and CHAARG (Changing Health Attitude + Actions to Recreate Girls). I am currently serving as the
 Panhellenic Delegate in Alpha Phi, and am involved in Cru. When I am not studying for classes, 
 I can be found at any athletic facility, as I am an active volunteer in the undergraduate event management 
 team assembled this year specifically for students in my major. I hope to one day have a job of significance 
 in the sport industry. Whether I work for a university, a franchise, an association, or a television network,
 I know this is the path for me. I am excited to continue my journey along it, and grateful to University of 
 Georgia for guiding me and giving me the tools to succeed. </p> <br>

 <p> <br> While I thoroughly enjoy all of the opportunities at UGA I have encountered so far, my favorite
 is Georgia football. I have been born and raised a Georgia Bulldog, and with 4 generations of my family 
 attending the University, it is fair to say that I bleed red and black. Both of my parents were here in 
 1980 when we won the National Championship, and have been waiting to go back for over 30 years. This year,
 the Dawgs started out the season with a perfect 9-0 record, undefeated. No year has been as successful
 since that fateful championship season as the current one, and it looks like the stars have aligned for
 another chance at the national title. The season began with high hopes as many seniors returned for their 
 final season, including renowned running back Nick Chubb, one of the top five running backs to ever come 
 out of UGA. Our quarterback, sophomore Jacob Eason, was number one in the nation coming out of high school,
 and looking strong before the season began. Shockingly however, in what seemed to be a catastrophic turn of events, Eason was 
 injured in the first game of the season against Appalachian State.</p> <br>

 <p> With Eason no longer able to lead the team, our true freshman quarterback began playing, Jake Fromm.
 Born and raised a UGA fan, and one of the top three quarterbacks in the nation coming out of high school, 
 Fromm was ready to play. His leadership and knowledge of the playbook has been evident on and off the field. 
 While there is much room for improvement and a need for more experience playing for a power five school, 
 Fromm has done well thanks to his offensive line protecting him, defense keeping him off the field, and 
 incredible receivers driving us down the field. Usually when all seems to be perfect, something falls apart,
 and unfortunately, on the weekend of November 11th, the Dawgs suffered their first loss of the season to the
 Auburn tigers. With a 9-1 record, there is still a strong chance that the Dawgs will make it all the way, but
 we will have to work much harder. Being the number one team in the nation was fun while it lasted, but as 
 they sayâ€¦ hungry dawgs eat better. <br> <br>For more information on Georgia football, check out the official
